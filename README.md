The combined bar and line plot provides a comprehensive overview of the bowling performance of each team:

1. **Wicket Taken**: The bars indicate the numbers of wickets each bowler took during the match. The height of the bars reflects how succesful the bowlers were in terms of taking wickets. Bowlers from both teams contributed to taking wickets, with some notable performances that stand out due to higher bars.

2. **Economy Rate**: The line graph overlaid on the bar graph shows the economy rate(number of runs conceded per over) of each bowler. The economy rate is crucial as it indicates how economically a bowler has bowled in terms of runs given away.

The above graph performs partnerships Analysis by calculating and visualizing the most productive batting partnership in match. We'll look at runs scored per partnership and how long each partnership lasted in terms of balls faced:
The bar chart displays significant batting partnerships from the match, highlighting partnerships that scored more than 20 runs. Here's how these insights contribute to our analysis:

1. The chart identifies key partnerships that likely had a substantial impact on the match's outcomes, effectiveness of batting pairs.

2. It provides insights into which players were involved in pivotal stands, which can help in assessing player forms and team strategy.

The plot above provides a clear breakdown of the match into different phases; Powerplay, Middle, and Death, and illustrate how each team performed during these segments:

1. **Powerplay**: Both teams have a relatively low total of runs, with RCB losing more wickets than DC in this phase, as indicated by the height of orange line.

2. **Middle**: This phase shows the higest run-scoring for both teams, with DC scoring slightly more than RCB. The wickets lost remain controlled, suggesting stable innings from both teams.

3. **Death**: RCB has a sharp decreasein runs compared to the middle phase, while DC maintains a high run rate. Wickets lost by RCB increased significantly in this phase, marked by the orange line peaking near 4.5, indicating a possible collapse or aggressive batting that did not pay off.

## Plot 7(Data) üìÅ

<img width="382" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-22 at 11 06 28 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02251b3b-5809-49f8-afba-45c8f14d861e" />

Now, let‚Äôs calculate the strike rates for all batters in this match and then analyze the data to see which players were the most effective in terms of scoring quickly. After calculating the strike rates, we can look at correlations with other variables such as runs scored or the phase of play during which the runs were scored. This can give us insights into which players accelerate scoring at crucial times or against specific bowlers.

Here are the top performers in terms of strike rate from the match:

1. **J Fraser-McGurk** had the highest strike rate at 262.50, scoring 21 runs from just 8 balls.
2. **Virat Kohli** also scored efficiently, with a strike rate of 192.86, making 27 runs from 14 balls.
3. **Rajat Patidar** contributed significantly with a strike rate of 152.94, accumulating 52 runs from 34 balls.

Now, let‚Äôs dive deeper by looking at how the strike rate varied with the phase of the game for these top performers. It could give insights into strategic scoring and game dynamics during different innings stages:

The bar chart illustrates how the strike rates of the top performers varied across different phases of the match:

**J Fraser-McGurk** stands out with a particularly high strike rate in the Middle phase, significantly higher than any other phase or player, suggesting a highly aggressive and effective batting performance during this part of the innings.

**V Kohli** and **RM Patidar** both have high strike rates in the Death phase, indicating their ability to accelerate scoring towards the end of the innings, which is crucial for setting or chasing targets.

**AR Patel** shows consistency in the Powerplay and Middle phases with a slightly reduced but still competitive strike rate, indicating his role as a steady opener or middle-order batter.

**KV Sharma** exhibits a lower strike rate in the Middle phase compared to others, suggesting a more conservative approach during this phase or difficulty in accelerating.

## Plot 9 üìä

To identify the turning point where Delhi Capitals (DC) might have lost the game and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) gained the upper hand, we can analyze the cumulative run rate comparison throughout the innings and look at wicket fall events. Specifically, we can:

**Compare Cumulative Run Rates**: Plot the cumulative run rates of both teams throughout their innings to see where RCB started to outpace DC significantly.

**Wicket Analysis**: Examine the timings and impacts of wicket falls on the scoring rate and momentum for DC.

**High-Impact Overs**: Identify any overs where RCB took multiple wickets or DC had a significantly low scoring rate, which could indicate a loss of momentum.

The plot shows the cumulative runs scored by each team throughout their innings, with markers indicating wickets:

**Momentum Shifts**: The points where wickets are lost are crucial. Despite wickets, RCB‚Äôs run line does not show any drastic downturns, suggesting effective recovery by subsequent batters.

**Performance Analysis**: RCB‚Äôs ability to keep the run rate up despite losing wickets might indicate deeper batting strength or successful innings pacing strategies. In contrast, DC, while also increasing their score, does so at a less steep rate, possibly indicating fewer big overs.

Now, let‚Äôs calculate the run rate for each over for both teams and see how the run rates changed throughout the innings, particularly focusing on the overs where wickets fell:

The plotted run rates for each over, along with the moments when wickets were taken (marked with large dots), provide insights into how the match‚Äôs dynamics evolved:

**RCB Run Rate Fluctuations**: RCB‚Äôs run rate shows significant fluctuations, peaking at around 3.5 runs per ball towards the end of the innings. The presence of wicket markers (red circles) indicates that wickets were taken during overs where the run rate was generally lower, which is typical as wickets tend to disrupt batting flow.

**DC Run Rate Patterns**: DC‚Äôs run rate starts strong but sees a sharp decline after the initial overs, stabilizing somewhat in the middle before another peak and subsequent fall towards the end. Wickets (blue circles) are taken in overs where the run rate drops, suggesting effective bowling from RCB during these times.

# Summary

The match between RCB and DC showcased a blend of strategic batting, aggressive bowling, and critical partnerships. RCB‚Äôs ability to maintain a higher cumulative run rate and effective wicket-taking in crucial overs contributed significantly to their victory. The detailed phase-wise and player-specific analysis not only highlights the dynamics of T20 cricket but also assists in understanding how momentum shifts and strategic decisions impact the game‚Äôs outcome.
